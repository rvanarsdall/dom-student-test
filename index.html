    <section>
      <p>
        This test you are about to take will test you on things that we think
        you should know at this point. You will be given 1 hour to get through
        the test. If you finish early you can work on your project. Once you are
        complete let an instructor or teacher assistant know.
      </p>
      <h3>For the Shopping List</h3>
      <p>
        In the JS file you will find an array of shopping items. You are going
        to display them in the shopping list section. Use the DOM query
        selectors that you have been taught in order to find and create list
        item elements.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Update the title of the Shopping list using JS to your first name's
          shopping list
        </li>
        <li>
          Loop through the array in the JS file and display the shopping list.
        </li>
        <li>Write a function that will title case the items in the array.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>For the Calculator</h3>
      <p>
        Using the same JS file use your DOM query selectors in order to grab the
        value of what was typed in the number1 and number2 input fields. You
        will then add the two numbers and display them in the p-tag with the id
        of <strong>display-total.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>fish for the form</li>
        <li>add an evenlistner</li>
        <li>don't forget about the preventDefault()</li>
        <li>use console logging and debuggers as needed</li>
        <li>You may need to use typeof to figure things out</li>
      </ul>
